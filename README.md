A simple gathering of info from fixing a work colleague's brand new Fender Contemporary Active Bass.
I ended up reverse engineering the schematic, for fault finding, as I couldn't find anything online, some of the capacitor values are missing as I didn't have time to measure them, that schematic is in the Kicad project file.
In addition, the wiring was atrocious, so I tidied it up and created a 3D-printed enclosure which can be wrapped in copper tape for screening.
The CAD files for the box are shared here: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e671b543c1c96459d90c71cc/w/820c5c013e8279f1abbdf756/e/54521195a4663bc38350ea31?renderMode=0&uiState=660f0c617c7edc4a2642d383
The STL files for printing can be found in this repo.
Hope it's useful!
